# Ticketmaster's House

# Project Objective
- Ticketmaster is a leading ticket seller for many events. However, an area where they are less prominent is house music events. There is a house music event every weekend in Los Angeles. Normally, the initial ticket sellers are DICE or AXS. I am helping Ticketmaster identify which venues, artists, and subgenres of house music they should target to increase their reach over the house music community. Therefore, increasing their revenue and reputation and also beating out their competitors.
- This will be done by using the Spotify API to gather data on the top subgenres of house music and the most popular artists in those subgenres. Then by webscraping EDM Train for upcoming events, the venues they are held at, and which venues are most popular for house music.
